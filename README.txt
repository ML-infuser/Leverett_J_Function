
The Leverett J-function helps engineers understand how fluid flow through porous media is affected by factors such as porosity and saturation. It is particularly useful in reservoir engineering for predicting fluid behavior in oil and gas reservoirs. By analyzing the relative permeability curves and using the Leverett J-function, engineers can optimize production strategies, design enhanced oil recovery techniques, and make informed decisions about reservoir management.

However, there are limitations to consider:

The Leverett J-function primarily focuses on single-phase flow, typically oil or gas. It may not adequately account for multiphase flow behavior.

The Leverett J-function may not accurately predict relative permeability behavior in extreme conditions, such as near the irreducible water saturation or at high water cuts.

While the Leverett J-function is commonly used in reservoir engineering, its applicability may be limited in unconventional reservoirs (e.g., tight gas sands, shale formations).
